# Arklength
Arklength is a calculator that takes in points from a function and returns the arc length of that function. \
Consider the arc-length formula:

Some integrations are impossible to perform, making this formula unusable in certain cases. \
The Arklength program will calculate the arc length by connecting the input points and returning the total distance. \
The calculator suffers from rounding/doubles errors, as well as bad style.
